Any client can assume the role of an intervention.  By doing so, the client
becomes the **official** implementation for said role.

Access
======

Controlling access to interventions deserves special mention.  On the
``/client/<client_id>`` page, the application developer may view and
alter the value of **public_accessible**.

.. note::

   With **public_accessible** set, the intervention will always be displayed.

When **public_accessible** is *not* set, two additional options exist for
enabling said intervention.
